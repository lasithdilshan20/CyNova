# CyNova Troubleshooting & FAQ

This guide lists common issues and their resolutions.

## HTML report not generated
- Ensure `generateHtml` option is `true` (default). If you disabled it in tests, re-enable for your project.
- Verify the process can write to `outputDir` (default: `reports`).
- Check logs: CyNova prints "Wrote HTML report to ..." or a warning if generation was skipped.
- If Handlebars is unavailable, CyNova falls back to a minimal HTML (still single file). You can force this for debugging via `CYNOVA_FORCE_FALLBACK=1`.

## "ws module not available" warning
- The live WebSocket server is optional. If you enable `liveServer.enabled` without installing `ws`, CyNova will log a warning and use a noop server.
- Fix by installing `ws` (dev dep is fine) or disabling `liveServer` in options.

## Charts not rendering
- CyNova inlines Chart.js when available. If chart.js is not installed, a small stub is used, and charts wonâ€™t render.
- Install `chart.js` to enable charts: `npm i -D chart.js`.

## Summary JSON missing spec details
- Ensure tests are executed in Cypress e2e mode and the run produced `results.runs` with spec data.
- Some unit/integration runs may not include spec/test details. Run Cypress with real specs to populate details.

## JSON not found by the standalone web index
- The webpack demo `dist/web/index.html` expects `cynova-summary.json` next to it. Place the JSON in the same folder.
- Or use the single-file HTML report generated by the plugin, which embeds data.

## Windows paths and permissions
- On Windows, ensure you use backslashes in CLI paths when needed, and that the `reports/` directory is writable.

## Live badge does not turn "on"
- Use `?live=1` query when opening the HTML: `cynova-report.html?live=1&host=127.0.0.1&port=9777`.
- Ensure the live server is enabled in CyNova options and the port is accessible.

## Custom template errors
- Verify your `templatePath` points to a valid `.hbs` file and that it includes placeholders for `{{{inlineCss}}}`, `{{{inlineJs}}}`, and `window.__CYNOVA__` JSON.

## Large test suites performance
- Use Cypress parallelization or split specs across CI machines.
- CyNova writes a compact JSON; HTML generation is O(n) in number of tests. For very large n, prefer analyzing JSON directly in CI and only generating HTML on demand.

## FAQ

- Q: Is CyNova compatible with component testing?  
  A: It focuses on e2e runs. Component testing may work but is not the primary target.

- Q: How do I add custom analytics?  
  A: Post-process `cynova-summary.json` in your pipeline; the schema is documented in `src/plugin/types.ts`.

- Q: Can I merge multiple runs into a single HTML?  
  A: Not yet. Use `cynova-history.json` for trends across runs or generate one HTML per run.
